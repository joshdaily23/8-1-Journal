The project was to create a clock that displayed the time in a 12 and 24 hour time format. I was to 
develop an object-oriented programming application that simultaneously display the two clocks. The one thing 
I was able to do particularly well was the creating of the loops. I was able to properly construct functioning loops 
that allowed for the user to input the hours, minutes, and seconds for the clock. However, my code needed work in properly
formatting the clock and outputting the right time. I wasn't able to produce the 24-hour format for my clock. I also
needed enhancements in the menu of my program. The most challenging part of the code to write was telling the program 
to format the the user's input in two different ways. I tried fixing this by referencing the textbook and referencing prior 
assignments, but I wasn't able to properly fix the formatting of the output. Transferrable skills from this program include the 
ability to create user friendly menus, proper double formatting for decimals, creating loops, and organization. I was able to
make a maintainable, readable, and adaptable program by writing comments throughout the program explaining what each line did.
It also helped me know where in the program I was so I didn't get lost and write something where it wasn't supposed to be.
